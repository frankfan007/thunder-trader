Based on C++ 11, this project implements a quantitative trading system supporting high-frequency transactions. The system supports the following characteristics:
> * Using plug-ins to support different quotations and trading interfaces, such as CTP, Femas, Dfitc and TWS in China.
> * support multiple accounts and multiple strategies. Each strategy can use multiple quotes, and can place orders for multiple accounts.
> * The real-time tracing of the variables in the policy can be realized by "probe" and the display mode of the data can be customized.
> * Supporting the "intervention" of the strategy, by predefining some intervention actions, to achieve a fixed operation in the transaction process.
> * adopt C/S architecture
